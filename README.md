Final Project – An optimal spatial-temporal sampling model of biotic stresses in agricultural fields
This repository contains all simulation codes developed for the final project.
File Organization:
	•	Files ending with Clusters.py implement the cluster-based detection 		approach.
	•	Files ending with Treatment.py implement the treatment-based detection 		approach.
Contents:
	•	Scripts to calculate the minimal sampling rate per region and season 		stage.
	•	Simulation scripts that run detection algorithms using the selected 		sampling rates.
	•	Analysis scripts for visualizing and comparing results across methods.
Note: Data files are not included in this repository due to their large size and privacy constraints.
